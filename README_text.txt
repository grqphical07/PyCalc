A simple scientfic CLI Calculator with history, ANS variable and more.

Plain text version of README

Start by using the solve command to solve a given equation

The ANS variable is the last answer done by any function

Supports these operations:
    - Addition: +
    - Subtraction: -
    - Multiplication: *
    - Division: /
    - Modulus/Remainder: %
    - Exponentation: **
        - Example: 5 ** 2 = 25, 2 ** 3 = 8
    - Floor Division: //
        - Example 7 // 2 = 3, 5 // 2 = 2
Functions:
    - Pythagoras Theorem (pyth a b)
    - Inverse Pythagoras (invpyth c b)
    - pi prints out the first 16 digits of pi and can be used in equations with the solve command
    - save: Saves the ANS variable to a file
        - Example: Saves ANS to a file called test.txt: save test
NOTE: 3(5 * 4) will not work use 3 * (5 * 4) instead
